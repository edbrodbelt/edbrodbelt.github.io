        <h2>Embedded Systems Project GPS</h2>
        <p>This project was an individual Embedded Systems Project where we were given an Mbed Development Board and over the course of about 10 weeks, had to develop a programme to demonstrate our C++ skills. The brief stated that commonly people would make arcade games, data loggers etc.</p>
        <p>Now I have never been much of a gamer, but have always enjoyed the outdoors, whether that be Mountain Biking, Skiing or Hiking, so I thought some project along those lines would ensure that I continued to develop it through out the full 10 weeks, because I would be interested in the topic.</p>
        <p>In the end I settled on a GPS device that has a Clock, Compass, Map and Activity Tracker Functionality.</p>
